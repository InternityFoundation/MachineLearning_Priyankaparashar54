Data visualization is the visual representation of data, so that patterns, trends and correlations that might not otherwise be detected can be exposed.

For the purpose of data visualization, we have taken a small online retail dataset which consists of 4 columns “country”, “age”, “salary”, “purchased”.

Python offers different types of plotting libraries, but here we have implemented using: -
1)	Matplotlib: It is a python library used extensively for the visualization of data.
2)	Seaborn: It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphs. You can create graphs in one line that would take you multiple tens of lines in Matplotlib.

Here I have plotted different types of plots: -
•	Scatter Plot
•	Line Chart
•	Histogram
•	Bar Chart
•	Box Plot
•	Heat Map
•	Implot
